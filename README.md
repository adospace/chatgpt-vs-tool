# AskChatGPT Visual Studio Extension
This extension for Visual Studio 2022 allows you to chat with ChatGPT directly inside the IDE.

The tool is integrated into the environment so that you can ask questions about your code, see answers with syntax highlighting and copy back to your classes or functions returned code.

Before using the extension you have to:

Obtain an API key from the OpenAI website at this URL: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
Create an environment variable called OPENAI_API_KEY with the created key
This tool is completely free under a permissive MIT license but the OpenAI service has a cost (https://openai.com/pricing)
